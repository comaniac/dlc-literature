## Summary
- Similar to [[Halide-Auto-Schedule-CPU]] that schedules an entire model.
- Model the problem of choosing the best schedule as a deterministic Markov Decision Process.
- Solve the MDP by iteratively improving (reinforcement learning) a value function to predict the best achievable performance over all remaining decisions.
-  Search time is less than 1 minute.
