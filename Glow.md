## Paper
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00907.pdf

## Summary
- A new IR for deep learning workloads presented by Facebook. Different from TVM or Halide IR, Glow IR is instruction-based, so it is more similar to LLVM IR.
- Lack of details in the paper.
- Only provide CPU backend. By the time the paper was published, only single thread is supported. Now it seems support multithreading, but still CPU only.
- Support heterogeneous execution.
