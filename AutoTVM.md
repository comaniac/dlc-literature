## Summary
- The auto-tuning framework based on [[TVM]].
- Search for the best parameter values in a predefined schedule template.
- Mainly rely on on-device measurements to determine the schedule quality.
- Use simulated annealing to generate the next schedule candidate.
- Use XGBoost as the cost model to identify a small set of schedule candidates from a large set of schedules generated by simulated annealing.
- Breakdown a program to tensors and use GBT and TreeGRU to encode tensor ASTs.
- The encoded tensor ASTs are used as feature to transfer the cost model learned from this program to other programs.
